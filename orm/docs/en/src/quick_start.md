# Surreal ORM Documentation

## Introduction

Surreal ORM is an Object-Relational Mapping and query-building library for Rust
that provides a high-level API for interacting with SurrealDB, a distributed
graph database. This documentation will guide you through the usage and features
of the Surreal ORM library.

## Getting Started

To use Surreal ORM in your Rust project, you need to add it as a dependency in
your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
surreal_orm = "0.1"
```

After adding the dependency, you can import the necessary modules in your Rust
code:

```rust
use surreal_orm::*;
```

## Connecting to SurrealDB

Before interacting with SurrealDB, you need to establish a connection to the
database. The following example demonstrates how to create a connection to a
local SurrealDB instance:

```rust
use surrealdb::engine::local::Mem;
use surrealdb::Surreal;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let db = Surreal::new::<Mem>(()).await.unwrap();
}
```

In this example, we create a new SurrealDB instance using the `Surreal::new`
function with the `local::Mem` engine. The `local::Mem` engine represents a
local in-memory database. You can replace it with other engine types according
to your setup.

## Defining a Model

A model in Surreal ORM represents a database table. You can define a model by
creating a Rust struct and implementing the `Node` or `Edge` trait. Here's an example of
defining a `SpaceShip` model:

```rust
use surreal_orm::*;

#[derive(Node, Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
#[surreal_orm(table = "space_ship")]
pub struct SpaceShip {
    pub id: SurrealSimpleId<Self>,
    pub name: String,
    pub age: u8,
}
```

In this example, we define a `SpaceShip` struct and annotate it with the `Model`
derive macro. The `table` attribute specifies the name of the corresponding
database table.

## Querying Data

Surreal ORM provides a fluent and expressive API for querying data from the
database. You can use the `select` function to start a select statement and
chain various methods to build the query. Here's an example:

```rust
use surreal_orm::statements::{select, All};

let space_ship::Schema { name, age, .. } = SpaceShip::schema();

let statement = select(All)
    .from(space_ship)
    .where_(name.equal("Millennium Falcon"))
    .order_by(age.desc())
    .limit(10);
```

In this example, we start a select statement using the `select` function and
pass the `All` argument to select all fields. We specify the table name using
the `from` method and add a condition using the `where_` method. We can also use
the `order_by` method to specify the sorting order and the `limit` method to
limit the number of results.

## Inserting Data

To insert data into the database, you can use the `insert` function and provide
the data as a vector of structs. Here's an example:

```rust
use surreal_orm::statements::insert;

let spaceships = vec![
    SpaceShip {
        id: "1".to_string(),
        name: "Millennium Falcon".to_string(),
        age: 79,
    },
    SpaceShip {
        id: "2".to_string(),
        name: "Starship Enterprise".to_string(),
        age: 15,
    },
];

insert(spaceships).return_many(db.clone()).await?;
```

In this example, we define a vector of `SpaceShip` structs and pass it to the
`insert` function. We then call the `run` method to execute the insertion
operation.

## Updating Data

To update data in the database, you can use the `update` function and provide
the updated data as a struct. Here's an example:

```rust
use surreal_orm::statements::update;

let spaceship = SpaceShip {
    id: "1".to_string(),
    name: "Millennium Falcon".to_string(),
    age: 60
};

update(spaceship).run(db.clone()).await?;
```

In this example, we define a `SpaceShip` struct with the updated data and pass
it to the `update` function. We then call the `run` method to execute the update
operation.

## Deleting Data

To delete data from the database, you can use the `delete` function and provide
the condition for deletion. Here's an example:

```rust
use surreal_orm::statements::{delete, Field};

let space_ship::Schema { name, age, .. } = SpaceShip::schema();
let condition = name.eq("Millennium Falcon");

delete(space_ship)
    .where_(cond(name.equal("Millennium Falcon")).and(age.less_then(50)))
    .run(db.clone())
    .await?;
```

In this example, we use the `delete` function and specify the table name as a
string. We add a condition using the `where_` method, and then call the `run`
method to execute the deletion operation.
