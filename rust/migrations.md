Creating migrations/20220123130525_create_users_table.sql

Congratulations on creating your first migration!

Did you know you can embed your migrations in your application binary?
On startup, after creating your database connection or pool, add:

sqlx::migrate!().run(<&your_pool OR &mut your_connection>).await?;

Note that the compiler won't pick up new migrations if no Rust source files have changed.
You can create a Cargo build script to work around this with `sqlx migrate build-script`.

See: https://docs.rs/sqlx/0.5/sqlx/macro.migrate.html
