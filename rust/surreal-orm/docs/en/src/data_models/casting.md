## Introduction to Casting

In programming, casting is the practice of converting variables from one type to
another, enabling more flexible data manipulation. Whether receiving input from
a user, reading data from a file, or interfacing with databases, casting becomes
a pivotal component.

### Casting to Boolean

This function converts a value into a boolean. In raw queries, it's represented
as `<bool>`.

```rust
let result = bool("true");
assert_eq!(result.build(), "<bool> true");
```

### Casting to Integer

Convert a value into an integer. In raw queries, it's represented by `<int>`.

```rust
let result = int(13.572948467293847293841093845679289);
assert_eq!(result.build(), "<int> 13");
```

### Casting to Float

Convert a value into a floating point number. In raw queries, it's represented
by `<float>`.

```rust
let result = float(13.572948467293847293841093845679289);
assert_eq!(result.build(), "<float> 13.572948467293847");
```

### Casting to String

Convert a value into a string. In raw queries, it's represented by `<string>`.

```rust
let result = string(true);
assert_eq!(result.build(), "<string> true");
```

### Casting to Number

Convert a value into an infinite precision decimal number. In raw queries, it's
represented by `<number>`.

```rust
let result = number(13.572948467293847293841093845679289);
assert_eq!(result.build(), "<number> 13.572948467293847293841093845679289");
```

### Casting to Decimal

Convert a value into an infinite precision decimal number. In raw queries, it's
represented by `<decimal>`.

```rust
let result = decimal(13.572948467293847293841093845679289);
assert_eq!(result.build(), "<decimal> 13.572948467293847293841093845679289");
```

### Casting to DateTime

Convert a value into a datetime. In raw queries, it's represented by
`<datetime>`.

```rust
let result = datetime("2022-06-07 will be parsed");
assert_eq!(result.build(), "<datetime> 2022-06-07");
```

### Casting to Duration

Convert a value into a duration. In raw queries, it's represented by
`<duration>`.

```rust
let result = duration("1h30m will be parsed");
assert_eq!(result.build(), "<duration> 1h30m");
```
