# Transaction Management in Surreal ORM

Surreal ORM provides transaction management capabilities to ensure the integrity
and consistency of database operations. This allows you to group multiple
database operations into a single atomic unit that can be committed or canceled
as a whole. This documentation covers the Begin Transaction, Commit Statement,
and Cancel Transaction features in Surreal ORM.

## Begin Transaction

The `begin_transaction` statement in Surreal ORM marks the beginning of a
transaction. It sets the context for a series of database operations that should
be treated as a single atomic unit. By starting a transaction, you can ensure
the integrity and consistency of your database operations.

To begin a transaction, you can use the `begin_transaction` statement. Let's see
an example:

```rust
let db = Surreal::new::<Mem>(()).await.unwrap();
db.use_ns("test").use_db("test").await.unwrap();

begin_transaction()
...
// Perform database operations within the transaction
;

// or
block!{
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    ...
// Perform database operations within the transaction
}


Ok(())
```

In the code snippet above, the `begin_transaction` statement is used to start a
transaction. This sets the context for the subsequent database operations.

## Commit Statement

The `commit` statement in Surreal ORM is used to commit a transaction and save
the changes made within the transaction. It ensures that the changes are durable
and permanent in the database.

### Recommended Approaches

#### Using `block!` Macro with Commit Statement also Within Block for Chaining Multiple Statements

To perform a transaction and commit the changes, you can use the `block!` macro
to chain multiple statements together. The `commit_transaction` statement is
used within the `block!` macro to explicitly indicate the commitment of the
transaction. Let's take a look at an example:

```rust
let db = Surreal::new::<Mem>(()).await.unwrap();
db.use_ns("test").use_db("test").await.unwrap();

let ref id1 = Account::create_id("one".into());
let ref id2 = Account::create_id("two".into());
let acc = Account::schema();

let amount_to_transfer = 300.00;

block! {
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;

    LET acc1 = create().content(Account {
        id: id1.clone(),
        balance: 135_605.16,
    });
    LET acc2 = create().content(Account {
        id: id2.clone(),
        balance: 91_031.31,
    });

    LET updated1 = update::<Account>(id1).set(acc.balance.increment_by(amount_to_transfer));
    LET update2 = update::<Account>(id2).set(acc.balance.decrement_by(amount_to_transfer));

    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
};

Ok(())
```

In the code snippet above, the `block!` macro is used to define a transaction
with multiple statements. The `LET` statement is used to bind variables `

acc1`,`acc2`,`updated1`, and`update2`to the respective statements.  The`BEGIN
TRANSACTION`statement marks the start of the transaction, and the`COMMIT
TRANSACTION` statement explicitly commits the transaction.

Using the `block!` macro with the `commit_transaction` statement within the
block provides a clear and concise way to define a transaction and commit the
changes.

#### Using begin_transaction function with `block!` Macro for Chaining Multiple Statements

Another recommended approach is to use the `block!` macro to chain multiple
statements together within a transaction. The `commit_transaction` statement is
called separately after the `block!` macro to explicitly commit the transaction.
Let's see an example:

```rust
let db = Surreal::new::<Mem>(()).await.unwrap();
db.use_ns("test").use_db("test").await.unwrap();

let ref id1 = Account::create_id("one".into());
let ref id2 = Account::create_id("two".into());
let acc = Account::schema();

let amount_to_transfer = 300.00;

let transaction_query = begin_transaction()
    .query(block! {
        LET acc1 = create().content(Account {
            id: id1.clone(),
            balance: 135_605.16,
        });
        LET acc2 = create().content(Account {
            id: id2.clone(),
            balance: 91_031.31,
        });

        LET updated1 = update::<Account>(id1).set(acc.balance.increment_by(amount_to_transfer));
        LET update2 = update::<Account>(id2).set(acc.balance.decrement_by(amount_to_transfer));
    })
    .commit_transaction();

transaction_query.run(db.clone()).await?;

Ok(())
```

In this approach, the `block!` macro is used to define a transaction block that
includes multiple statements. The `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT TRANSACTION`
statements mark the start and end of the transaction, respectively. The `LET`
statement is used to bind variables to the statements within the block.

Using the `block!` macro for chaining multiple statements and explicitly
committing the transaction provides a more structured and organized way to
handle complex transactions.

### Less Recommended Approach

The less recommended approach involves chaining multiple statements directly
without using the `block!` macro. Although functional, this approach may feel
less ergonomic, especially when there is a need to bind and share variables
within the statements.

#### Chaining Multiple Statements Directly

Here's an example of chaining multiple statements directly without using the
`block!` macro:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_transaction_commit_increment_and_decrement_update() -> SurrealOrmResult<()> {
    let db = Surreal::new::<Mem>(()).await.unwrap();
    db.use_ns("test").use_db("test").await.unwrap();

    let ref id1 = Account::create_id("one".into());
    let ref id2 = Account::create_id("two".into());
    let amount_to_transfer = 300.00;

    let acc = Account::schema();

    begin_transaction()
        .query(create().content(Account {
            id: id1.clone(),
            balance: 135_605.16,
        }))
        .query(create().content(Account {
            id: id2.clone(),
            balance: 91_031.31,
        }))
        .query(update::<Account>(id1).set(acc.balance.increment_by(amount_to_transfer)))
        .query(update::<Account>(id2).set(acc.balance.decrement_by(amount_to_transfer)))
        .commit_transaction()
        .run(db.clone())
        .await?;

    // Assertions and other code...

    Ok(())
}
```

In this approach, multiple statements are chained directly within the
transaction. The `create` and `update` statements

are used to perform operations on the `Account` table.

The less recommended approach of chaining multiple statements directly can be
less ergonomic, especially when dealing with complex transactions that require
variable bindings and subqueries.

It is generally recommended to use the recommended approaches with the `block!`
macro for better readability, automation of variable bindings, and subquery
handling.

## Cancel Transaction

The `cancel` transaction feature in Surreal ORM allows you to roll back a
transaction and discard the changes made within the transaction. It is useful
when you want to undo a series of database operations within a transaction.

To cancel a transaction, you can use the `cancel_transaction` statement. Let's
see an example:

```rust
let db = Surreal::new::<Mem>(()).await.unwrap();
db.use_ns("test").use_db("test").await.unwrap();

let transaction_query = begin_transaction()
    .query(create().content(Account {
        id: Account::create_id("one".into()),
        balance: 135_605.16,
    }))
    .cancel_transaction();

transaction_query.run(db.clone()).await?;

Ok(())
```

In the code snippet above, the `cancel_transaction` statement is used to cancel
the ongoing transaction. This ensures that any changes made within the
transaction are discarded, and the database state remains unchanged.

## Handling Transactions with Database Operations

When performing database operations within a transaction, it is important to
ensure that the operations are executed as a single atomic unit. Surreal ORM
provides transaction management features to facilitate this.

To handle transactions with database operations, you can follow these steps:

1. Begin the transaction using the `begin_transaction` statement.
2. Chain the necessary database operations using the appropriate ORM statements.
3. Use the recommended approaches described earlier to define and commit the
   transaction.
4. If needed, use the `cancel_transaction` statement to cancel the transaction
   and discard any changes.

By following these steps, you can ensure the integrity and consistency of your
database operations and handle transactions effectively.

That concludes the documentation for the Begin Transaction, Commit Statement,
and Cancel Transaction features in Surreal ORM. Use the recommended approaches
to perform transactions, commit changes, handle cancellations, and manage your
database operations effectively.
