## Sleep Statement Usage

The `SLEEP` statement is used to introduce a pause in the program or query
execution. It takes a duration parameter to specify the length of the pause.
Here's an example:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

let statement = sleep(Duration::from_secs(43));
```

In the code snippet above, we create a `Duration` object with a duration of 43
seconds and pass it to the `sleep` function to create the `SLEEP` statement.

You can use the `SLEEP` statement to introduce delays or pauses in your program
or query execution to control the timing of your operations effectively.

That concludes the documentation for the `SLEEP` statement in Surreal ORM. Use
the provided examples and explanations to introduce pauses in your program or
query execution as needed.
